# Dark+ Black Theme for Obsidian

An Obsidian theme inspired by the [Dark+ Black VSCode theme](https://github.com/vsalvino/dark-plus-black) by Vince Salvino. This theme brings the pure black background and carefully crafted syntax highlighting of the popular VSCode theme to Obsidian.

## Features

- **True Black Background**: Pure black (`#000000`) background for maximum contrast and OLED screen benefits
- **Precise Color Matching**: Carefully matched colors from the original VSCode Dark+ Black theme
- **Configurable Accent Color**: Change the accent color through Obsidian's appearance settings
- **Syntax Highlighting**: Code blocks use the same syntax highlighting colors as VSCode
- **Clean UI**: Minimalist interface with subtle borders and well-defined UI elements
- **High Contrast Text**: Readable light gray text on black background
